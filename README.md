# Spotify-Recommendation-Engine
End to End Azure Technology Spotify Recommendation Engine  

**Abstract:**
This project investigates the fusion of Spotify API with Azure technology to construct a sophisticated music recommendation system. By harnessing the extensive music repository and user data provided by the Spotify API, the research team utilizes Azure services to efficiently process and analyze this wealth of information. Leveraging Azure's scalable infrastructure and machine learning capabilities, the system generates personalized music recommendations for users based on their historical listening patterns, preferences, and behavioral data. Through the integration of Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cosmos DB, collaborative filtering algorithms and user-item recommendation models are implemented to deliver precise and pertinent music suggestions. Furthermore, Azure Functions are employed to ensure real-time updates and seamless synchronization with the Spotify platform. This project exemplifies the collaborative potential between Spotify API and Azure technology, showcasing how cloud-based solutions can elevate the music consumption experience by providing tailored recommendations to users.

1. Dataflow Store: The project commenced with the establishment of Azure Data Lake Storage, serving as the repository for vast volumes of user and consumer behavior data. This robust storage solution provided the requisite scalability, file system semantics, and file-level security crucial for big data analytics.

2. Read: Azure Databricks was seamlessly integrated to connect and extract data from Azure Data Lake Storage. This ingestion process facilitated the preprocessing and registration of data for model training. Azure Databricks emerged as the linchpin, orchestrating the initial data flow with precision and efficiency.

3. Preprocess: Data preprocessing emerged as the next critical phase, involving comprehensive cleansing, transformation, and preparation of the dataset. Through meticulous preprocessing, the data was refined and optimized for ingestion into the recommendation system model, ensuring its readiness for subsequent stages.

4. Train: Training the recommendation model unfolded in two distinct steps: feature engineering and model training. Leveraging Azure Databricks, the preprocessed dataset was utilized to train and elucidate the behavior of various recommendation models. This phase was characterized by rigorous experimentation and evaluation to identify the optimal model configuration.

5. Postprocess: Following model training, the project transitioned to the postprocessing phase, where models underwent thorough evaluation and selection based on performance metrics. Azure Databricks played a pivotal role in orchestrating model evaluation, ensuring that only the most effective models progressed to the deployment phase.

6. Deploy: Azure Databricks assumed responsibility for managing and deploying the trained recommendation model. Leveraging batch managed endpoints, the model was exposed for consumption, supporting both batch and near-real-time recommendations. Azure Databricks facilitated seamless integration and accessibility, ensuring the model's availability for frontend display.

7. Write: The culmination of the project involved the consumption of model results by user interfaces, such as web applications. Azure Synapse served as the conduit for capturing and storing model-driven insights, facilitating batch inference and storage of results in the respective datastore.

Throughout the project, the cohesive integration of Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics formed the backbone of the architecture, empowering the creation of a robust and scalable music recommendation system.
