# Spotify-Recommendation-Engine
End to End Azure Technology Spotify Recommendation Engine  

**Abstract:**
This project investigates the fusion of Spotify API with Azure technology to construct a sophisticated music recommendation system. By harnessing the extensive music repository and user data provided by the Spotify API, the research team utilizes Azure services to efficiently process and analyze this wealth of information. Leveraging Azure's scalable infrastructure and machine learning capabilities, the system generates personalized music recommendations for users based on their historical listening patterns, preferences, and behavioral data. Through the integration of Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cosmos DB, collaborative filtering algorithms and user-item recommendation models are implemented to deliver precise and pertinent music suggestions. Furthermore, Azure Functions are employed to ensure real-time updates and seamless synchronization with the Spotify platform. This project exemplifies the collaborative potential between Spotify API and Azure technology, showcasing how cloud-based solutions can elevate the music consumption experience by providing tailored recommendations to users.
